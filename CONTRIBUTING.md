# Contributing

Welcome to the **setup-comparator** project!

First of all, keep in mind this is a project to showcase and improve my programming skills.

That said, I believe we can all learn together, thus I will leave some [easier issues] opened for beginners to start collaborating so we can all enjoy the experience!

If you have any doubts, don't hesitate to reach me out on the [discussions section].

## Environment details

You can check how to get the project up and running in the [README](README.md#how-to-use).

## Issues

If you want to report a bug, request a new feature or anything else, feel free to open an issue. Choose the issue template that fits best when opening it.

Ask if you can work on an issue so I can assign it to you, to avoid overlapping ourselves.

## How to submit changes (Pull Requests)

I encourage you to open a pull request soon (draft pull request) to see if you're in the good direction to solve the issue!

Remember to make use of the linting commands **`yarn lint`** and **`yarn lintcss`** as well as the build command **`yarn build`** to maximize the chances of the pull request succeeding.

Set up properly your code editor to get notified at the moment of code warnings and errors without having to run the linting commands.

**Always base your Pull Request on the *dev* branch**.

## Style guide / Coding conventions

Make sure to follow these coding rules:

### CSS Rules

- Indentation: 4 spaces
- Leading zeroes: yes (âœ“ 0.3rem | ~~.3rem~~)
- Trailing zeroes: no (âœ“ 1.1rem | ~~1.10rem~~)
- Quotes: single
- Properties in alphabetical order
- Hex colors: long format (âœ“ #000000 | ~~#000~~)

### TSX Rules

- Name the variables **like_this**, unless it's in a react Hook (useState), then it would be **likeThis**
- Name the functions **likeThis()**

## Testing

To be decided, there are no tests on the project yet.

## Thank you

Thank you for be willing to collaborate on the project, it means a lot to me.

HAPPY CODING! ðŸ’»
